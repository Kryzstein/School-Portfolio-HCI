<b><h2>Introduction:</h2></b>

Cyfer is a simple and secure password manager designed to help users safely store, generate, and manage their login credentials. 
It was created with the goal of making digital security easy and accessible, especially for users who aren’t very tech-savvy. 
Cyfer focuses on a clean, minimal interface that encourages good password habits while providing strong protection and ease of use.

<b><h2>Usage Instruction:</h2></b>

<b><h3>Cyfer is designed to be simple, secure, and user-friendly. Here’s how users can manage their passwords effectively:</b></h3>

<b><h4>Create an Account:</b></h4> Sign up with your email and create a strong master password. This will be the only password you need to remember. You can also enable biometric login (Face ID or fingerprint) for faster access.

<b><h4>Generate Strong Passwords:</b></h4> Use CYFERS’s built-in password generator to create strong, unique passwords. Customize the length and character types, then save or copy them directly to your vault.

<b><h4>Organize Your Credentials:</b></h4> Sort your saved logins using folders or tags like “Work,” “Personal,” or “School.” Use the search bar to find what you need instantly.



<b><h2>Other Relevant Information</h2></b>

Although the Cyfer prototype is not connected to a real database and does not store actual user data, it represents how the final app would work in a secure and encrypted environment.
The current design is optimized for mobile screens.
